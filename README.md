# Functionalities

The primary functionality of this project involves the exchange of assets from Wrapped Ether (WETH) to Tether (USDT) through various decentralized exchanges, with the objective of obtaining the most favorable exchange rate available among them.

To achieve the desired goal, two methods of swapping assets have been implemented. These two methods are utilized to demonstrate how a similar goal can be attained through two distinct procedures. These methods have been called:

1. CommonSwaps.
2. DEXAggregatorSwaps.
